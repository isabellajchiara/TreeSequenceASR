# TreeSequenceASR

Tree sequence allows us to infer the relationship between haplotpes over time

These scripts take two inputs:

1) haplotype data pulled from AlphaSimR Breeding Simulations
2) the locations of each segregating site and the alleles at that site

The backage tsinfer allows us to infer the tree sequence and conduct analyses using the tree sequence
